Together, these limitations can delay vendor payments which can strain relationships and result in late fees. To offset the drawbacks of a manual matching process, many AP departments have turned to automation for three-way matching.

Over time, aggregators combined access to these payment gateways. This process works because any merchant who signs up with the aggregator does not have their own MID and is instead classified as a sub-merchant under the aggregator's MID umbrella.

This information is then used by a merchant’s merchant account provider, or acquirer, who will either approve or deny the payment. A payment processor is used to move the funds from one account to another and a payment gateway is used to ensure the transaction is encrypted, utilizing the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards with (PCI DSS)  secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Once a payment has been finalized it is directly deposited into the merchant’s account, usually within 3-5 business days. With an effective electronic payment system, the merchant can then make payments to their vendors, directly depositing funds with ACH transactions.",

A hiring business works closely with an independent contractor while negotiating a contract to determine payment terms: an agreeable hourly or project rate and payment frequency. From there, the contractor submits invoices in alignment with the pay frequency. At the end of the year, the hiring company provides a 1099-NEC that summarizes the total amount they have been paid. Then, each contractor files their own self-employment taxes that include social security tax and medicare taxes. They also have the ability to submit deductions for business expenses. ",
